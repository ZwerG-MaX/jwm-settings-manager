TODO:
Version 2.0

*Icons
 - figure out a good way to include all subdirectories of a certain icon theme...
 -  Maybe read the theme file???  I should see if Puppy does this for anything.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>
for doing it manually...

*Desktop
 - eventually provide support for different bg on each desktop, or at least check for this possibility

*themes
 - redo the theme interface to have a preview that is generated by each clicked theme in the list.  pull the filenames from:
/usr/share/jwm-settings-manager/themes/
~/.jwm/themes

*Keyboard
- add a key grabber, as the current implementation is pretty ugly and inefficient and hard to use (though it works)

* Make a cairo box for displaying svg files

SCRIPTS
background changer - fix this eventually

*Panel
- make a Fl_Browser to arrage the items on the panel
